        <h1>Life is an Optimization Function: How to Optimize It</h1>
        <p>Welcome warrior to the pursuit of mastery and balance—where every decision is a step closer to unlocking life’s full potential.</p>
        <p>In this article, I'll tell you exactly why I think life is an optimization function, how I used this thought and belief to optimize my life by staying motivated, and how you can apply this thinking so you are the best version of yourself.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Is Life An Optimization Function?</h2>
        <p>When I brought this idea up to my friends, most of them disagreed and thought this was quite controversial. In fact, in my ROTC unit, I was told the following:</p>
        <p>"What the fuck does optimize mean? Why can't you just live life and enjoy it? Life is not all just math and equations PENG!"</p>
        <p>"What do you even mean by win over the long run? I know you say you are quite happy with your life, but your need to micromanage every hour is sad."</p>
        <p>There are a bunch more criticisms of this idea, but you get the rationale behind these guys. They simply see the method of systematically and quantitatively defining life as flawed because it complicates it unnecessarily and ruins the 'fun' you have.</p>
        <p>What if I were to tell you that the word "optimize" means by definition: make the best or most effective use of (a situation, opportunity, or resource), and an "optimization function" means to "find the input to a given function that results in the minimum or maximum output from the function. The objective depends on certain characteristics of the system, called variables or unknowns."</p>
        <p>This means that life is indeed an optimization function! Just like in a mathematical optimization function, you have certain "constraints" (time, energy, money) in order to achieve an "optimal" output (happiness, satisfaction, fame, success).</p>
        <p>In other words, an optimization function is simply an ABSTRACTION (if you are confused about this word, please ChatGPT what abstract means and why it is important!) of our goals in life, and by acknowledging this to be true, we can FIGURE OUT how to "min max" life based on our inputs to try to get AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE to our desired outputs.</p>

        <h2>What Does It Mean to Optimize Life?</h2>
        <p>Optimization is the art of achieving the best possible outcome given your constraints. In life, these constraints might be time, energy, or resources. The goal is not to be perfect (because each human has skill limits which we'll talk about later at each given moment, and you can't have infinite growth even if you wanted to) but to consistently improve in as CLOSE TO AN OPTIMAL MANNER as possible to become the ideal version of yourself.</p>
        <p>Why is this knowledge important and POWERFUL? Because this means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your life is directly impacted by YOUR ACTIONS because YOU CONTROL THE INPUTS (hard work, vision, strategy, planning, networking).</li>
            <li>What you desire simply relies on your hard and smart work as well as your corresponding OUTPUT TO INPUT RATIO. If not, you may need to "change your game" and play a better game where you are more advantaged so you don't waste your time and energy.</li>
            <li>You have A LOT OF TIME. Assuming you live for 80 years, you get 29220 days, meaning you get up to 29220 ITERATIONS to "reroll the die" if you fail. This means you have thousands of chances to fail and still succeed.</li>
            <li>While you have a lot of control over your input, a lot of inputs you DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER such as other people, economic situations, your starting position (family), etc. But do not use this as an excuse! Years of disciplined and deliberate decisions will ALWAYS produce better outcomes than inaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Steps to Optimize Life</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Define Your Objective Function:</strong> Know what success looks like to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Constraints:</strong> Time, energy, relationships—work within your limits to avoid burnout.</li>
            <li><strong>Break Down Problems:</strong> Break challenges into smaller steps to tackle them effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment and Iterate:</strong> Treat life like a series of experiments. Learn from failures, adjust, and refine your approach.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn from Others:</strong> Seek mentors, study great thinkers, and leverage their lessons to avoid unnecessary mistakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Work and Joy:</strong> Optimization doesn’t mean losing sight of life’s pleasures. Recharge, but stay mission-focused.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Journey of Optimization</h2>
        <p>The common man will not understand the words in this blog. When you, my friend, finish reading this idea—that life can be quantified, systemized, and broken down into components to get what you want—you set yourself on a permanent and never-ending trajectory for achieving your optimization function to accomplish YOUR objective.</p>
        <p>I'll leave off with this. Greatness exists on a different dimension. Transcend the known; become the incomprehensible.</p>
        <p>Good luck.</p>
