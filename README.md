# Fun-Personal-Website-Project
In this mini project I will have some fun by learning a bit of HTML in order to build a fun little website on github pages :)

For reference on HOW I built this simple website on github pages (I plan to move into an actual website soon), please look at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0

Enjoy!
